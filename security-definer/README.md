## Create private visualizations

This will show you how to create visualizations with row-level control over which users can see what. There are two examples, a simple [SingleTable](read-only/SingleTable.md) example and then building on that a [MultiTable](read-only/MultiTable.md) example. They are just what they say, examples that have a single private table or multiple private tables that can be accessed by defined users with known keys. 

## Features

 * Multiple users with unique keys
 * Ability to cycle keys 
 * Group level permissions so multiple users can share the same permissions
 * Ability to use data from private maps in both visualizations and over the SQL API

## Table level security
